# FastAPI MongoDB CRUD Application

This is a REST API built with **FastAPI** and **MongoDB** that supports CRUD operations for managing items and user clock-in records. The project uses MongoDB for data storage and provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete records.

## Features

1. **Items API**:
   - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing items.
   - Filtering of items by various fields (email, expiry date, etc.).
   - Aggregation to count items per email.

2. **Clock-In Records API**:
   - CRUD operations for managing user clock-in records.
   - Filtering clock-in records based on email, location, and time.
